# Quadcoptor_Simulator

Course project for AERSP424 (Advanced computer programming)

The purpose of the software is to let the user test the quadrotor in the virtual environment using the keyboard inputs analogous to a handheld controller. Different parameters for the quadcopter such as the motor rpm, motor-voltage dependence, arm lengths, mass, and the response time can be modified. These parameters are available only to the software developers and can be changed only in the code. For other users, this software doubles up to a quadcopter flight controller game with the fixed dynamics. 

This software project closely reflects the use of object oriented programming C++ to solve ordinary differential equations and update the parameters in real time to realise the trajectory of the quadrotor. This trajectory is displayed in real-time on the screen for visual feedback for the user.
